# Add Autonomous Mode Documentation

[auto-commit]

## Task

Update the README.md file to document the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag for users who want a more autonomous workflow with Claude Code.

## Requirements

- Add a new section after the "Tips for Working with Claude" section
- Title the section appropriately (e.g., "Autonomous Mode" or "Hands-Free Development")
- Explain that running `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` enables a more autonomous workflow
- Include clear, prominent warnings about the risks:
  - This mode should NOT be used in live production environments
  - Changes made by Claude can have permanent, irreversible effects
  - The user is responsible for reviewing all changes
  - Recommend using this only in development/sandbox environments
- Suggest best practices for using this mode safely (e.g., git commits, backups, isolated environments)
- Keep the tone informative but cautionary

## Expected Outcome

README.md contains a new section documenting the autonomous mode flag with appropriate warnings, helping users understand both the benefits and risks of this workflow.
