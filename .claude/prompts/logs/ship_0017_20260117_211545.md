## Session Info
- **Session ID**: ship_0017_20260117_211545
- **Started**: 2026-01-17 21:15:45
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Request**: Create /pilot and /land commands for interactive development workflow

## Context Snapshot
- **Git Branch**: master
- **Git Status**: clean
- **Working Directory**: C:\Users\Waz\AndroidStudioProjects\launchpad

## Plan
1. Create `/pilot` command - interactive version of /ship that:
   - Works with user present for entire execution
   - Asks questions and resolves ambiguities interactively
   - Builds and installs app for user testing
   - Waits for user verification before proceeding
   - Creates progress logs
   - Does NOT commit (leaves changes pending for /land)

2. Create `/land` command - commits pilot changes:
   - Takes pending changes from pilot session
   - Creates prompt documentation
   - Commits with auto-numbered message
   - Updates logs
